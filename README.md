# PSoC&trade; 4: MSC self-capacitance touchpad tuning

This code example demonstrates how to use the CAPSENSE&trade; middleware to detect a finger touch position on a self-capacitance-based touchpad widget in PSoC&trade; 4 devices with multi sense converter (MSC).

In addition, this code example also explains how to manually tune the self-capacitance-based touchpad for optimum performance with respect to parameters such as reliability, power consumption, response time, and linearity using the CSD-RM sensing technique and CAPSENSE&trade; tuner GUI. Here,  CAPSENSE&trade; sigma delta (CSD) represents the self-capacitance sensing technique and RM represents the ratiometric method.

3. After programming, the application starts automatically.

4. To test the application, slide your finger over the CAPSENSE&trade; touchpad and notice that the user LED turns ON when touched and turns OFF when the finger is lifted.

5. You can also monitor the CAPSENSE&trade; data using the CAPSENSE&trade; tuner application as follows:

    **Monitor data using CAPSENSE&trade; tuner**

    1. Open CAPSENSE&trade; tuner from the Tools section in the IDE Quick Panel. 
    
        You can also run the CAPSENSE&trade; tuner application standalone from the *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ModusToolbox/tools_{version}/capsense-configurator/capsense-tuner*. In this case, after opening the application, select **File** > **Open** and open the *design.cycapsense* file of the respective application, which is present in the *{Application root directory}/COMPONENT_CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS/TARGET_\<BSP-NAME>* folder. 

	     SeeÂ theÂ [ModusToolbox&trade;Â userÂ guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide)Â (locallyÂ availableÂ atÂ *{ModusToolboxÂ installÂ directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*)Â forÂ optionsÂ toÂ openÂ theÂ CAPSENSE&trade;Â tunerÂ applicationÂ usingÂ theÂ CLI.

    2. Ensure the kit is in CMSIS-DAP bulk mode (KitProg3 Status LED is ON and not blinking). See [Firmware-loader](http://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) to learn on how to update the firmware and switch modes in KitProg3.
  
    3. In the tuner application, click on the **Tuner Communication Setup** icon or select **Tools** > **Tuner Communication Setup**. In the window that appears, select the I2C checkbox under KitProg3 and configure as follows: 

       - **I2C address: 8**
       - **Sub-address: 2-Bytes**
       - **Speed (kHz): 1000**

        These are the same values set in the EZI2C resource.

        **Figure 2. Tuner communication setup parameters**

        <img src="images/tuner_setup.png" alt="Figure 2" width="500" />

    4. Click **Connect** or select **Communication** > **Connect** to establish a connection.

    5. Click **Start** or select **Communication** > **Start** to start data streaming from the device. 
   
       The tuner displays the data from the sensor in the **Widget View**, **Graph View**, and **Touchpad View** tabs. 

    6. Set the **Read Mode** to Synchronized mode. Under the **Widget View** tab, you can see the touchpad widget highlighted in blue color when you touch it. 

       **Figure 3. Widget view of the CAPSENSE&trade; tuner**

       <img src="images/widget-view.png" alt="Figure 3" width="900"/>

    7. You can view the raw count, baseline, difference count, and status for each sensor and also the touchpad position in the **Graph View** tab. For example, to view the sensor data for touchpad 0, select **Touchpad0_Col0** under **Touchpad0**.

       **Figure 4. Graph view of the CAPSENSE&trade; tuner**

       <img src="images/graph_view.png" alt="Figure 4" width="900"/>

    8. The **Touchpad View** tab shows the heatmap view and the finger movement can be visualised on the same.

       **Figure 5. Touchpad view of the CAPSENSE&trade; tuner**

       <img src="images/touchpad-view.png" alt="Figure 5" width="900"/>

    9. Observe the **Widget/Sensor Parameters** section in the CAPSENSE&trade; tuner window. The compensation CDAC values for each touchpad sensor element calculated by the CAPSENSE&trade; resource is displayed as shown in **Figure 15**. 
      
   10. Verify that the SNR is greater than 5:1 by following the steps given in **Stage 4** starting with **Step 6**.
   
     Non-reporting of false touches and the linearity of the position graph indicate a proper tuning.
   
   **Note:** The touchpad performance can be further enhanced by configuring the board to connect the hatch pattern to shield. To do so, see the kit user guide for the board connection settings. Make sure you enable the shield signals in the CAPSENSE&trade; configurator as shown in **Figure 6**. Then, retune the touchpad following the tuning process explained in [Tuning procedure](#tuning-procedure).

    **Figure 6. Enabling shield signals in CAPSENSE&trade; configurator**

    <img src="images/shield-settings.png" alt="Figure 6" width="700"/>

## Tuning procedure

<details><summary><b> Create custom BSP for your board </b></summary>

1. Create a custom BSP for your board having any device, by following the steps given in [KBA231373](https://community.cypress.com/t5/Knowledge-Base-Articles/ModusToolbox-2-2-and-later-Make-a-Custom-BSP-KBA231373/ta-p/251107).In this code example, it was created for the device "âCY8C4149AZI-S598â.

2. Open the *design.modus* file from *{Application root directory}/TARGET_\<BSP-NAME>/COMPONENT_BSP_DESIGN_MODUS* folder obtained in the previous step and enable CAPSENSE&trade; to get the *design.cycapsense* file. CAPSENSE&trade; configuration can then be started from scratch as explained below.

</details>

The following steps explain the tuning procedure. 

**Note:** See the section "Selecting CapSense hardware parameters" in the [AN85951 â PSoC&trade; 4 and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://www.cypress.com/an85951) to learn about the considerations for selecting each of the parameter values.

**Figure 7. CSD touchpad widget tuning flow**  

<img src="images/flowchart_for_tuning.png" alt="Figure 7" width="500" />

Do the following to tune the touchpad:

<details><summary><b> Stage 1. Set the initial hardware parameters</b></summary>

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Launch the Device Configurator tool.
   
   You can launch the Device Configurator in Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software from the Tools section in the IDE Quick Panel or in stand-alone mode from *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ModusToolbox/tools_{version}/device-configurator/device-configurator*. In this case, after opening the application, select **File** > **Open** and open the *design.modus* file of the respective application, which is present in the *{Application root directory}/COMPONENT_CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS/TARGET_\<BSP-NAME>* folder. 
   
   **Note**: If you are using the custom BSP with the Empty PSoC&trade; 4 starter application, use *{Application root directory}/TARGET_\<BSP-NAME>/COMPONENT_BSP_DESIGN_MODUS* folder to open the *design.modus* file.

3. In the [CY8CKIT-041S MAX kit](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/psoc-4100s-max-pioneer-kit-cy8ckit-041s-max), the touchpad pins are connected to both channel 0 and channel 1. Hence, make sure you enable channel 0 and channel 1 in the Device Configurator as shown in **Figure 8**.

     **Figure 8. Enable MSC channels in Device Configurator**

     <img src="images/device-configurator-multi-channel.png" alt="Figure 8" width="900"/>

     Save the changes and close the window.

4. Launch the CAPSENSE&trade; configurator tool.
   
   You can launch the CAPSENSE&trade; configurator tool in Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software from the 'CAPSENSE&trade;' peripheral setting in the Device Configurator or directly from the Tools section in the IDE Quick Panel. You can also launch it in standalone mode from *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ModusToolbox/tools_{version}/capsense-configurator/capsense-configurator*. In this case, after opening the application, select **File** > **Open** and open the *design.cycapsense* file of the respective application, which is present in the *{Application root directory}/COMPONENT_CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS/TARGET_\<BSP-NAME>* folder.

   **Note**: If you are using the custom BSP with the Empty PSoC&trade; 4 starter application, use *{Application root directory}/TARGET_\<BSP-NAME>/COMPONENT_BSP_DESIGN_MODUS* folder to open the *design.cycapsense* file.

   See the [ModusToolbox&trade; software CAPSENSE&trade; configurator tool guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxCapSenseConfig) for step-by-step instructions on how to configure and launch CAPSENSE&trade; in ModusToolbox&trade; software. 

5. In the **Basic** tab, note that a single touchpad **Touchpad0** is configured as a **CSD RM (Self-cap)** and the CSD tuning mode is set as **Manual tuning**. 

   **Figure 9. CAPSENSE&trade; configurator - Basic tab**  

   <img src="images/capsense_basictab.png" alt="Figure 9" width="1050" />

6. Do the following in the **General** tab under the **Advanced** tab:
   - Set **Scan mode** as **CS-DMA** to enable autonomous scanning. 
   
     For applications with large number of sensors like trackpad, automated scan using DMA is helpful for scanning multiple sensors autonomously, which helps in improved refresh rate and offloading the CPU. 

     Ensure to do the required DMA settings in the **Device Configurator** as given in the [KBA233869](https://www.cypress.com/KBA233869).

   - **Sensor connection method** is **CTRLMUX** by default for CS-DMA Scan mode. 
   
     Use CTRLMUX if your schematic has all the sensors on ctrlmux pins. CTRLMUX mode allows the MSC block to control the GPIO pins and removes the need of AMUXBUS to transfer CAPSENSE&trade; signals between GPIO and the MSC block.

   - Set **Modulator clock divider** as **1** to obtain the maximum available modulator clock frequency as recommended in the [AN85951 â PSoC&trade; 4 and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://www.cypress.com/an85951).

       **Note:** The modulator clock frequency can be set to 48,000 kHz only after changing the IMO clock frequency to 48 MHz, since the modulator clock is derived from the IMO clock. Follow these steps:

       1. Under the **System** tab in the **Device Configurator** tool, select **System Clocks** > **Input** > **IMO**. 
    
       2. Select **48** from the **Frequency(MHz)** drop-down list.
   
   - **Number of init sub-conversions** is set based on the hint shown when you hover over the edit box. Retain the default value (Will be set in **Stage 3**)

   - Check the Enable self-test library selection. This is required for sensor capacitance measurement using BIST.
   
   - Retain the default settings for all filters. You can enable the filters later depending on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements in **Stage 5**).
     
     Filters are used to reduce the peak-to-peak noise. Using filters will result in higher scan time.

   **Figure 10. CAPSENSE&trade; configurator - General tab under the Advanced tab**  

   <img src="images/adv_general.png" alt="Figure 10" width="700" />

7. Go to the **CSD Settings** tab and make the following changes:
  
   - Set **Inactive sensor connection** as **Shield**.

     Inactive sensors connected to Shield provide better performance in terms of SNR and Refresh rate (as the use of shield results in reduction of sensor Cp) and can also be used if your design requires liquid tolerance.  

   - Set **Shield mode** as **Active**.

     MSC provides active and passive shielding. Active shielding is preferred for high-performance applications and passive shielding is preferred for low-power applications. Before enabling this option, ensure that your design has shield electrode(s). 

   - Set **Total shield count** as **0**.

     This is equal to the number of shield electrodes in your design. It is zero when only the inactive sensors are shielded.

   - Select **Enable CDAC auto-calibration** and **Enable compensation CDAC**. 
   
     This helps in achieving the required CDAC calibration levels (85% of maximum count) for all sensors in the widget while maintaining the same sensitivity across the sensor elements.

   **Figure 11. CAPSENSE&trade; configurator - CSD Settings tab under the Advanced tab**  

   <img src="images/csd_advanced.png" alt="Figure 11" width="700" />

8. Go to the **Widget Details** tab. Select **Touchpad0** from the left pane, and then set the following:
   
   - **Maximum X-Axis position** and **Maximum Y-Axis position** to **160** and **100**, respectively, as it is a 16*10 touchpad.

   - **Column sense clock divider:** Retain the default value (will be set in **Stage 3**)

   - **Row sense clock divider:** Retain the default value (will be set in **Stage 3**)
   
   - **Clock source:** **Direct**

      **Note:** Spread Spectrum Clock (SSC) or PRS clock can be used as a clock source to deal with EMI/EMC issues.

   - **Number of sub-conversions: 110**

     110 is a good starting point to ensure a fast scan time and sufficient signal. This value will be adjusted as required in **Stage 5**.

   - **Finger threshold: 20**

     Finger threshold is initially set to a low value, which allows the *Touchpad View* to track the finger movement during tuning.

   - **Noise threshold: 10** 

   - **Negative noise threshold: 10** 

   - **Hysteresis: 5**

     These values reduce the influence of baseline on the sensor signal, which helps to get the true difference-count. Retain the default values for all other threshold parameters; these parameters are set in **Stage 6**.

   **Figure 12. CAPSENSE&trade; configurator - Widget details tab under the Advanced tab**  
      
   <img src="images/adv_widget_detail.png" alt="Figure 12" width="700" />

7. Go to the **Scan Configuration** tab to select the pins and the scan slots. Do the following:

   Set the parameters in the **Scan configuration** tab as shown in **Figure 13**.

   **Figure 13. Scan configuration tab**

   <img src="images/scan-configuration.png" alt="Figure 13" width="1000"/>

   1. Configure channels for the row and column electrodes using the drop-down menu.

      As shown in **Figure 13**, the row and column pins are divided equally between channel 0 and channel 1.

   2. Configure pins for the electrodes using the drop-down menu.

   3. Configure the scan slots using **Auto-assign Slots** option.

       The summary section in the **Scan configuration** tab shows 13 scan slots (for 26 sensors), with each channel scanning in each slot simultaneously. This helps to perform parallel scanning and reduces the total scan time. 

   - Each sensor is allotted a scan slot based on the slot number.

   - The slots are assigned such that the sensors, which are under parallel scanning, are as far as possible from each other.

      **Note:** Row sensors cannot share a scan slot with a column sensor.

     See [AN85951 â PSoC&trade; 4 and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://www.cypress.com/an85951) for more details on Scan slot allotment rules. 

   - Check the notice list for warning or errors.

8. Click **Save** to apply the settings.

</details>

<details><summary><b> Stage 2. Measure the parasitic capacitance (Cp) </b></summary>

To determine the maximum row/column Cp, measure the Cp of each sensor element of the touchpad, between the sensor electrode (sensor pin) and device ground, using an LCR meter or using the built-in-self-test library.

It can also be estimated by back-calculating for Cs (sensor capacitance) using the Raw Count equation. See the **Equation CSD-RM Raw Count** in [AN85951 â PSoC&trade; 4 and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://www.cypress.com/an85951) for the Raw Count equation.

**Measure sensor and shield capacitances using BIST:**

Use the `Cy_CapSense_MeasureCapacitanceSensorElectrode()` API to measure the parasitic capacitance (Cp) of each touchpad sensor to determine the maximum Cp out of all the sensors. 

Use the `Cy_CapSense_MeasureCapacitanceShieldElectrode()` API to measure the total Shield capacitance (Cp) of the touchpad. 

**Note:** Use the `Cy_CapSense_SetInactiveElectrodeState()` API to set the inactive electrode state to "Shield" before calling the above functions, as these functions use "Ground" as the default inactive electrode state irrespective of what is set in the configurator.

If you are using the empty PSoC&trade; 4 starter application, you can copy the respective source code, from this exampleâs main.c file to the main.c file of the application project. If you are using this code example, the required files are already in the application.

Do the following to determine the Cp values in debug mode:

1. Program the board in Debug mode.

   In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**.
   
   For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*.

2. Place a breakpoint after the capacitance measurement.

3. In the **Expressions** window, add the Cp measurement variables: `sense_cap`, `shield_cap_ch0` and `shield_cap_ch1`. 

   The status of the measurement can also be read through the return values `sensor_meas_status` and `shield_meas_status` in the **Expressions** window.

4. Click the **Resume** button (green arrow) to reach the breakpoint. 

   Note that the function return values read `CY_CAPSENSE_BIST_SUCCESS_E` and the measurement variables provide the capacitance of the sensor elements in *femtofarads*.

   **Figure 2. Sensor/Shield capacitance measurement values obtained in debug mode**

   <img src="images/cp-measurement.png" alt="Figure 2" width="1000" />

5. Click the **Terminate** button (red box) to exit debug mode.

<details><summary><b> Stage 3. Calculate the sense clock frequency and Init sub-conversions </b></summary>

1. Calculate the row and column sense clock frequencies using **Equation 1**, **Equation 2** and **Equation 3**.

   **Equation 1. Max sense clock frequency from sensor capacitance**

   <img src="images/fsw-equation.png" alt="Equation 1" width="350" />

    Where,
   - F<sub>SW(Row)(Max,Cs)</sub> and  F<sub>SW(Col)(Max,Cs)</sub> are the maximum row and column sense clock frequency based on sensor capacitance, respectively.

   - C<sub>S(Row)</sub> and  C<sub>S(Col)</sub> are the maximum parasitic capacitances of the row and column electrodes respectively. **Note:** C<sub>S</sub> = C<sub>P</sub> when there is no finger present on sensor.

   - R<sub>Series</sub> is the maximum total series resistance, which includes the 525-ohm (for CTRLMUX mode) internal resistance , the external series resistance (in CY8CKIT-041S MAX, it is 2 kilo-ohm), and the trace resistance. Include the trace resistance if high-resistive material such as ITO or conductive ink is used. The external resistor is connected between the sensor pad and the device pin to reduce the radiated emission. ESD protection is built into the device.

   **Equation 2. Max sense clock frequency from shield capacitance**

   <img src="images/fsw-equation-with-shield.png" alt="Equation 2" width="500" />

    Where,
   - F<sub>SW(Row)(Max,Cshield)</sub> and  F<sub>SW(Col)(Max,Cshield)</sub> are the maximum row and column sense clock frequency based on shield capacitance, respectively.

   - C<sub>sh</sub> is the maximum shield parasitic capacitance between channel 0 and channel 1.

   - R<sub>Series</sub> is the maximum total series resistance, which includes the 250-ohm (for CTRLMUX and active shield mode) internal resistance, the external series resistance (in CY8CKIT-041S MAX, it is 2 kilo-ohm), and the trace resistance. Include the trace resistance if high-resistive material such as ITO or conductive ink is used. The external resistor is connected between the sensor pad and the device pin to reduce the radiated emission. ESD protection is built into the device.

   **Equation 3. Max sense clock frequency**

   F<sub>swMAX</sub> = min(F<sub>swMAX,Cs</sub>,F<sub>swMAX,Cshield</sub>)

   From **Equation 3**, we see that the maximum sense clock frequency is choosen such that both the sensor and shield electrodes charge and discharge completely. Hence the minimum frequency value out of the two,i.e., based on sensor Cp and shield Cp is selected. 
   
   **Note 1:** If LCR meter is not available, set an initial sense clock divider value and look at the charge and discharge waveforms of the sensor and shield electrodes and iteratively change the divider using the CAPSENSE&trade; tuner and set a maximum frequency such that it completely charges and discharges in each phase of the MSC CSD sensing method.

   **Note 2:** The maximum frequency set should charge and discharge the sensor completely, which you can verify using an oscilloscope and an active probe. To view the charging and discharging waveforms of the sensor, probe at the sensors (or as close as possible to the sensors), and not at the pins or resistor.

   **Note 3:** **Figure 14** shows the waveforms when the sensors and shield is not fully charging and discharging:

   **Figure 14. Incomplete charging and discharging**

   <img src="images/sensors-charging-incomplete.png" alt="Figure 14" width="350"/>

2. Ensure that the following conditions are also satisfied when selecting the sense clock frequency:

   - The auto-calibrated CDAC and Compensation CDAC value should lie in the valid range for the selected sense clock divider and Compensation CDAC divider. Verify this once the initial hardware parameters are loaded into the device. See **Step 3** (*Ensure that the auto-calibrated CDAC is within the recommended range*) of **Stage 4** for more details.

   - If you are explicitly using the PRS or SSCx clock source to lower electromagnetic interference, ensure that you select the sense clock frequency that meets the conditions mentioned in the [ModusToolbox&trade; software CAPSENSE&trade; configurator guide](https://www.cypress.com/file/492896/download) in addition to the above conditions. PRS and SSCx techniques spread the frequency across a range. 

   -  If you want to scan Channel 0 and Channel 1 in the same scan slot simultaneously, the sense clock divider and the number of sub-conversions should be the same for both sensor elements.

     **Table 2. Sense clock frequency settings for CY8CKIT-041S-MAX Kit**

    | Kit | R<sub>SeriesTotal</sub> (â¦) for sensors| R<sub>SeriesTotal</sub> (â¦) for shield | Maximum column Cp (pF) | Maximum row Cp (pF) | Total shield Csh (pF) |Maximum column sense clock frequency (kHz) based on sensor Cp | Maximum row sense clock frequency (kHz) based on sensor Cp |  Maximum sense clock frequency (kHz) based on shield Csh | Actual column sense clock frequency (kHz) | Actual row sense clock frequency (kHz) | 
    | :--------- | :------------| :----  | :------------ | :------ |:------- |:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
    | CY8CKIT-041S-MAX | 2525 | 187.5 |  28 | 18 | 260 | 707 | 1100 | 1025 | 706 | 1000 |

    **Note 1:** Here, all the unused sensor electrodes are ganged to form the shield electrode. R<sub>SeriesTotal</sub> (â¦) for shield is obtained by parallel combination of the resistances (external + internal) of each usused sensor electrode (i.e. configured as "Shield").  

    Total resistance on each unused sensor line: 2000+ 250 = 2250

    Number of  unused sensors (per channel): 12

    Therefore, parallel resistance obtained: 2250/12 = 187.5 â¦

    Total shield capacitance Csh (per channel) is also calculated as parallel combination of individual parasitic capacitances of the shield electrodes.
    
    **Note 2:** Actual sense clock frequency value is choosen such that the divider is divisible by 4, in order to have all the four scan phases for equal durations. 

    **Note 3:** The sense clock divider value, as given by **Equation 4**, is obtained by dividing HFCLK (48 MHz) by **Maximum Column Sense Clock Frequency (kHz)** and **Maximum Row Sense Clock Frequency (kHz)** calculated in **Stage 3** (see **Table 2**) and choosing the nearest ceiling sense clock divider option in the Configurator.
      
      **Equation 4. Sense clock divider**

      ![Equation 4](images/scd-equation.png)

      In this case, column sense clock divider = 48000/707 = 68 and Row sense clock divider = 48000/1025 = 48.

   Set the calculated value using the steps given in **Step 8** in **Stage 1**, which ensures the maximum possible sense clock frequency (for good gain) while allowing the sensor capacitance to fully charge and discharge in each phase of the MSC CSD sensing method. In addition, also ensure that the shield waveform is probed and that it satisfies the condition given in the section **Shield Electrode Tuning Theory** in the [AN85951 â PSoC&trade; 4 and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://www.cypress.com/an85951).

3. Calculate and set the **Number of init sub-conversions** using **Equation 5** and the steps given in **Step 6** in **Stage 1**

   Note: **Equation 5** is considering the default values of Cmod=2.2nF, Base % = 0.5 (50%), Auto-calibration % = 0.85 (85%). If you intend to change any value, refer to the [AN85951 â PSoC&trade; 4 and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://www.cypress.com/an85951) to calculate the required number of init sub-conversions.

      **Equation 5: Number of init sub-conversions** 

      <img src="images/no-init-sub-conv.png" alt="Equation 5" width="160" />

      where,

      VDDA = 5 V

      Cs = Least self-capacitance value out of the sensors in pF (obtained in Stage2)

</details>

<details><summary><b> Stage 4. Obtain cross-over point and noise </b></summary>

1. Program the board.

2. Check the calibration pass/fail status from the return value of the function `Cy_CapSense_Enable()`. 

3. Launch the CAPSENSE&trade; tuner to monitor the CAPSENSE&trade; data and for CAPSENSE&trade; parameter tuning and SNR measurement.
 
   See the [CAPSENSE&trade; tuner guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxCapSenseTuner) for step-by-step instructions on how to launch and configure the CAPSENSE&trade; tuner in ModusToolbox&trade; software.

4. Ensure that the auto-calibrated CDAC is within the recommended range.

   **Note:** Calibration may fail if the obtained rawcounts is not within the targetted range. 

   As discussed in **Step 2** of **Stage 3**, the sense clock divider will be tuned to bring the CDAC values to the recommended range in this step. 
   
   - Click **Touchpad0** in the **Widget Explorer** to view the Column reference CDAC value and Row reference CDAC value in the sensor parameters window as shown in **Figure 14**.
   - Also, click each sensor element, for instance, **Touchpad0_Col0** in the **Widget Explorer** to view the Compensation CDAC in the sensor parameters window as shown in **Figure 14**. 
   - If the reference CDAC values are within the range (20/Compensation CDAC Divider) to 255 and Compensation CDAC values are in the range 1 to 255, the following step is not required.

   **Figure 14. CDAC value**

   <img src="images/tuner-cdac-setting.png" alt="Figure 14" width="500"/>

   Refer to the [AN85951 - PSoC&trade; 4 and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://www.cypress.com/an85951) for recommended guidelines on the valid CDAC range (with and without compensation) to result in calibration PASS across multiple boards due to board-to-board variations.
 
5. Fine-tune the sense clock divider to bring the CDAC value within range.

   From the raw count equation ( see [AN85951 â PSoC&trade; 4 and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://www.cypress.com/an85951)), it is evident that increasing the sense clock divider will decrease the reference CDAC value for a specific calibration percentage and vice versa. 

   1. If the column reference CDAC value and row reference CDAC value are not in the recommended range, increase the column sense clock divider and row sense clock divider, respectively, in the Widget Hardware Parameters window.

   2. Click **To Device** to apply the changes to the device as shown in **Figure 15**.
      
   3. Click each sensor element, for instance, **Touchpad0_Col0** in the Widget Explorer.

   4. Observe the Compensation CDAC value in the **Sensing Parameters** section of the Widget/Sensor Parameters window.

   5. Click **To Device** to apply the changes to the device as shown in **Figure 15**.

      **Figure 15. Apply changes to device**

      <img src="images/tuner-apply-to-device.png" alt="Figure 15" width="600"/>

   6. If the CDAC values are still not in the required range, reduce the Modulator Clock Frequency to 24 MHz.
   
   7. Repeat steps 1 to 6 until you obtain reference CDAC values in the range (20/Compensation CDAC Divider) to 255 and Compensation CDAC values are in the range 1 to 255.

      **Note:** As **Figure 14** shows, CDAC values are in the recommended range when the Column Sense Clock Divider is 68 and Row Sense Clock Divider is 64. You can leave the sense clock divider to the value as shown in **Step 8** of **Stage 3**.

4. Capture the raw counts of each sensor element in the touchpad (as shown in **Figure 16**) and verify that they are approximately (+/- 5%) equal to 85% of the MaxCount. See [AN85951 â PSoC&trade; 4 and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://www.cypress.com/an85951) for the MaxCount equation.

   1. Go to the **Touchpad View** tab and change the **Display settings** as follows:

      - **Display mode:** - Touch Reporting

      - **Data type:** - **RawCount**

      - **Value type:** - **Current**

      - **Number of samples:** - **500**

    **Figure 16. Rawcounts obtained on the touchpad view tab in Tuner window**  

     <img src="images/touchpad-view-rc.png" alt="Figure 16"  width="1000" />
 
5. Capture and note the peak-to-peak noise of each sensor element in the touchpad. 

   1. From the **Widget Explorer** section, select the widget *Touchpad0*. 

   2. Go to the **Touchpad View** tab and change the **Display settings** as follows:

      - **Display mode:** - Touch Reporting

      - **Data type:** - **RawCount**

      - **Value type:** - **Max-Min**

      - **Number of samples:** - **500**
   
      Capture the variation in the rawcounts for 500 samples, without placing a finger (which gives the peak-to-peak noise) and note the highest noise.

    **Figure 17. Noise obtained on the Touchpad View tab in Tuner window**  

     <img src="images/touchpad-view-noise.png" alt="Figure 17"  width="1000" />

     **Table 3. Max Peak-to-Peak Noise Obtained in CY8CKIT-041S-MAX**
   
      |Kit | Max Peak-to-peak Noise for Row Sensors| Max Peak-to-Peak Noise for Column Sensors|
      |:----------|:-------------------------| :------|
      |CY8CKIT-041S-MAX   | 7 | 10|

6. View the row and column sensor signals in the **Graph View** tab in the **Sensor Signal** graph display by swiping your finger across the touchpad from top to bottom and left to right respectively.     

7. Firmly hold the finger (typically 8 mm or 9 mm) on the touchpad in the Least Touch Intensity (LTI) position (at the intersection of 4 nodes) as shown below. See [AN85951 â PSoC&trade; 4 and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://www.cypress.com/an85951) for more details on Least Touch Intensity (LTI) position. 
   
   **Figure 19. Least touch intensity (LTI) position**  

   <img src="images/lti-position.png" alt="Figure 19" width="100" />

   **Note:** Finger movement during the test can artificially increase noise level.

      1. Go to the **Touchpad View** tab and change the **Display settings** as follows:
          
         - **Display mode:** - Touch Reporting

         - **Data type:** - **DiffCount**

         - **Value type:** - **Current**

         Place the finger such that equal signal is obtained in the two intersecting column and row sensors respectively (look at the heatmap displayed in the **Touchpad View** tab as shown in **Figure 20**).

         **Note:** The LTI signal is measured at the farthest point (not at the last column/row) of the touchpad from the sensor pin connection, where the sensors have the worst case RC-time constant.

      **Figure 20. LTI position in Touchpad view**  

      <img src="images/touchpad-view-lti.png" alt="Figure 20" width="1000" />

      Row LTI Signal = (49 + 51 )/2 = 50, Column LTI Signal = (57 + 57)/2 = 57

</details>

<details><summary><b> Stage 5. Use the CAPSENSE&trade; tuner to fine-tune sensitivity to achieve 5:1 SNR </b></summary>

The CAPSENSE&trade; system may be required to work reliably in adverse conditions such as a noisy environment. The touchpad sensors need to be tuned with SNR > 5:1 to avoid triggering false touches and to make sure that all intended touches are registered in these adverse conditions.

**Note:** For gesture detection, it is recommended to have around 10:1 SNR.

1. Ensure that the LTI signal count is greater than 50 and meets at least 5:1 SNR (using **Equation 6**). 

   In the CAPSENSE&trade; tuner window, increase the **Number of sub-conversions** (located in the **Widget/Sensor Parameters** section, under **Widget Hardware Parameters**) by 10 until you achieve atleast 5:1 SNR.

   **Equation 6:** 

   <img src="images/snr-equation.png" alt="Equation 6" width="200" />

   Where,
    
    - LTI signal is the signal obtained as shown in **Figure 20**
    
    - Pk-Pk noise is the peak-to-peak noise obtained as shown in **Figure 17**

    SNR is measured for row sensors and column sensors seperately, using **Equation 6**.
   
   Here, from **Figure 17** and **Figure 20**, 
   
   SNR of column sensors = 57/10 = 6, SNR of row sensors = 50/7 = 7

   **Note:** Ensure that the **Number of Sub conversions** (Nsub) do not exceed the maximum limit and saturate the raw count.

   Use **Equation 7** to calculate maximum number of sub conversions: 

   **Equation 7:** 
   
   ![Equation 7](images/nsub-eqn.png)

   Max Nsub = 2^16/68 = 65536/68 = 963 [16 bit counter]

   Nsub is also tuned to satisfy the Refresh rate that is required. 

   **Equation 8. Scan Time**

   <img src="images/scan-time-equation.png" alt="Equation 8" width="150"/>

   **Note:** Total scan time is equal to the sum of initialization time and the scan time given by **Equation 8**.

2. After changing the **Number of sub-conversions**, click **Apply to Device** to send the setting to the device. The change is reflected in the graphs.

   **Note:** The **Apply to Device** option is enabled only when the **Number of sub-conversions** is changed.

####  Verify refresh rate and response time

   1. Response time of the touchpad can be visualised using LEDs to indicate toggling of sensor GPIOs when touched. 

   2. Refresh rate is a combination of sensor initialization time, scan time (as per **Equation 8**), processing time, and tuner communication time, which can be verified using the tuner as shown in **Figure 21**.

      **Figure 21. Refresh rate measurement** 

      <img src="images/tuner-refresh-rate.png" alt="Figure 21" width="900"/>

   3. You can also measure the refresh rate by toggling one of the GPIOs in each sensor scan loop. Probing the GPIO (P10.4 on J3) on the Oscilloscope shows the refresh rate as shown in **Figure 22**.

      **Figure 22. Probing GPIO for refresh rate** 

      <img src="images/probed-refresh-rate.png" alt="Figure 22" width="400"/>

      **Note:** Refresh rate obtained here is with the tuner closed, as tuner is only used for the purpose of debugging and will not play a role in deciding the refresh rate in the end application. 
      
      Refresh rate from **Figure 22** = 1 /2.16 ms = 463 Hz

</details>

<details><summary><b> Stage 6. Use CAPSENSE&trade; tuner to tune threshold parameters </b></summary>

After confirming that your design meets the timing parameters, and the SNR is greater than 5:1, set your threshold parameters.

**Note:** Thresholds are set based on LTI position, because it is the least valid touch signal that can be obtained.

  1. Set the recommended threshold values for the touchpad widget using the LTI signal value obtained in **Stage 5**:
   - **Finger threshold** â 80% of the lower LTI signal (either Row or Column)
   - **Noise Threshold** â Twice the highest noise or 40% of the lower LTI signal (whichever is greater)
   - **Negative Noise Threshold** â Twice the highest noise or 40% of the lower LTI signal (whichever is greater)
   - **Hysteresis** - 10% of the lower LTI signal
   - **ON Debounce** â Default value of 3 (Set to 1 for gesture detection)
   - **Low Baseline Reset** - Default value of 30
   - **Velocity** - Default value of 2500
   
     **Note:** Velocity parameter is not required for single finger detection.

   **Table 4. Software tuning parameters obtained for CY8CKIT-041S-MAX** 
  
   |Parameter|	 CY8CKIT-041S-MAX|
   |:--------|:------|
   |Number of sub-conversions	| 110	| 
   |Finger threshold 	| 40 | 
   |Noise threshold |20| 
   |Hysteresis	| 5 | 
   |ON debounce	|3| 
   |Low baseline reset	| 30| 
   |Negative noise threshold	| 20 | 

### Applying settings to firmware

1. Click **Apply to Device** and **Apply to Project** in the CAPSENSE&trade; tuner window to apply the settings to the device and project, respectively. Close the tuner.

   **Figure 23. Apply to project**

   <img src="images/apply_to_project.png" alt="Figure 23" width="500" />

   The change is updated in the *design.cycapsense* file and reflected in the CAPSENSE&trade; Configurator.

</details>

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

## Design and implementation

The project uses the [CAPSENSE&trade; middleware](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/capsense/capsense_api_reference_manual/html/index.html); see the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](http://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) for more details on selecting a middleware. 

See [AN85951 â PSoC&trade; 4 and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://www.cypress.com/an85951) for more details of CAPSENSE&trade; features and usage. 

The design has a ratiometric self-capacitance (CSD-RM) based, 26-element (10+16) CAPSENSE&trade; touchpad and EZI2C peripheral. The EZI2C Slave peripheral is used to monitor the sensor data and touchpad touch position information on a PC using the CapSense tuner available in the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox via I2C communication.  

The firmware scans the touchpad widget using the CSD-RM sensing method and turns ON the corresponding LED when a finger touch is detected and sends the CapSense rawcount, status and position data over an I2C interface to the CapSense Tuner GUI tool on a PC using the onboard KitProg USB-I2C bridge.

#### Steps to set up the VDDA supply voltage in Device Configurator

1. Open Device Configurator from the Quick Panel. 

2. Go to the **System** tab. Select the **Power** resource, and set the VDDA value under **Operating Conditions** as shown in **Figure 24**. 

   **Figure 24. Setting the VDDA supply in System tab of Device Configurator**

   <img src="images/vdda-settings.png" alt="Figure 24" width="600"/> 

**Note**: [PSoC&trade; 4100S Max pioneer kit](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/psoc-4100s-max-pioneer-kit-cy8ckit-041s-max) has two onboard regulators - 3.3V and 5V. To use 3.3V, place the jumper J10 at positions 2 and 3 and change the VDDA voltage and VDDD voltage in Device Configurator - Systems tab to 3300mV (see Figure 24). See the kit user guide for more details.
